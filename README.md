CrmApplication
==============

This project is a Maven multi-module application built using Java EE 7 ( JSF 2.2 & primefaces / EJB 3 / JPA 2.1 ). It's a simple crm that manage the communication between a smartphones vendor and clients.
The project consists of three main modules :
  * CrmApplication-ejb : contains the business logic of the application ( EJB / JPA )
  * CrmApplication-web : contains the front end of the crm (JSF 2.2 and primefaces ).

Our goal is to change the front end from JSF/Primefaces to vaadin
